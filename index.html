            <p>This article talks about the impacts and current trends of AI (artificial intellignce) technology on the world of photography and art. I have often thought that AI is bad for the world of photography and art in general. It felt fake and unauthentic to create and benefit from art or photos generated by AI. This article has changed my mind through arguing that AI will actually make us more efficient in our use of photography. Technologies like Arsenal can help newcomers into professional photography by recommending settings to create a good photo. Photo manipulation has always been a large part of the photography world, AI is simply another tool in our arsenal to enhance our photo abilities, and create new and exciting things. I think that AI can lead to making things like professional photography more accesible to small businesses and startups as well as enhancing the work of professionals. In the end, AI is not the death of traditional photography, but a new era for photographers to experiment with.</p>
