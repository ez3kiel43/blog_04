            <p>This article talks about the impacts and current trends of AI (artificial intellignce) technology on the world of photography and art. I have often thought that AI is bad for the world of photography and art in general. It felt fake and unauthentic to create and benefit from art or photos generated by AI. This article has changed my mind through arguing that AI will actually make us more efficient in our use of photography. Technologies like Arsenal can help newcomers into professional photography by recommending settings to create a good photo. Photo manipulation has always been a large part of the photography world, AI is simply another tool in our arsenal to enhance our photo abilities, and create new and exciting things. I think that AI can lead to making things like professional photography more accesible to small businesses and startups as well as enhancing the work of professionals. In the end, AI is not the death of traditional photography, but a new era for photographers to experiment with.</p>

            <p>3-D printing has come a long ways since its original inception in 1980. I think that it will continue to develop as a tool for engineers, designers, and all types of different industries. "Additive manufacturing lets us rethink how we build things", and i think that it can help us rethink how we do many things related to building, design, and media. </p>

            <p>While sodium batteries are still in the early stages of development, they provide an interesting prospect to replacing lithium-ion batteries. There are still many challenges before this new technology will be adopted such as supply chains not being as supportive but in the long run sodium is potentially more cost effective, abundant, and eco-friendly.</p>

            <p>'Bioacoustics' can be used to track the biodiversity of an area and scientists are finding ways to incorporate AI in this tracking. Reforested areas, expecially in tropical forests, are critical for the future of biodiversity and climate change on our planet. Using AI to detect different sounds, different species can be identified and tracked in an area that was lacking in biodiversity to see how that changes over time.</p>
